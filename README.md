# music-player-freecodecamp-js

Hands-on learnign project using web audio API.

The application enables user to play, pause, play next and preious songs, shuffle the playlist, remove songs.
In this application I used some essential string and array methods like the find(), forEach(), map(), join(), filter(), sort(), arrow functions, callback functions.
Used shuffling randomizing algorithm to shuffle the playlist.
The Javascript code dynamically updates the user interface according to the song playing.
